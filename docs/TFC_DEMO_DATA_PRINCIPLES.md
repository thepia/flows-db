## 🚀 Success Criteria

The demo data should enable prospects to:
1. **Understand the Model**: Clear pay-per-process pricing
2. **See the Value**: Bulk discounts and predictability
3. **Trust the System**: Realistic patterns and scale
4. **Envision Their Usage**: Relatable scenarios
5. **Calculate ROI**: Clear cost vs. benefit

## 📝 Notes for Implementation

- Use realistic names from each company's geographic regions
- Include some "messy" data (corrections, adjustments) for authenticity
- Show both successful patterns and recovered-from problems
- Include future-dated auto-replenish schedules
- Generate variety in payment methods and frequencies
- Create some "story" transactions (bulk hiring event, restructuring)

## 🚧 TODO: Role Flag Functionality Review

**IMPORTANT**: During demo data implementation, the following contact role flags were removed from account_contacts and moved to admin_access table due to schema constraints:

**Removed from Contact Config:**
- `can_initiate_workflows` - Ability to start onboarding/offboarding processes
- `can_view_usage_analytics` - Access to usage reporting and analytics
- `can_download_reports` - Permission to export reports and data
- `can_manage_integrations` - Access to API and system integrations
- `can_view_credit_transactions` - Detailed credit transaction history access

**Action Required:**
1. **Schema Review**: Verify if these flags should be in account_contacts or admin_access table
2. **UI Impact**: Update Account tab to reflect actual available permissions
3. **Demo Data**: Restore appropriate role-based permissions in demo data
4. **Documentation**: Update contact role definitions to match implemented schema

**Business Impact:**
These permissions are crucial for realistic demo scenarios showing different user roles and access levels within client organizations.

This principled approach ensures our TFC demo data tells a compelling, realistic story that resonates with prospects while demonstrating the system's capabilities at scale.
