# Fun Loading Animation Showcase

## 🎨 **Animated Onboarding Scene**

I've created a delightful SVG animation that tells the story of employees joining a company - perfect for the flows-admin-demo loading states!

### **🎬 Animation Story**
The loading animation depicts a charming onboarding scenario:

1. **Office Building** - A simple office with windows as the central hub
2. **Three People** - Animated figures walking toward the building from different directions:
   - **Blue person** walks in from the left
   - **Green person** walks in from the right  
   - **Orange person** walks down from the top
3. **Floating Documents** - Papers that gently float and fade in/out above the scene
4. **Success Checkmarks** - Green checkmarks that appear at different times
5. **Data Flow Lines** - Animated flowing lines representing data processing
6. **Sparkles** - Twinkling effects for visual delight
7. **Company Logo** - Pulsing "F" (for Flows) in the building center

### **⚙️ Technical Features**

#### **Responsive Sizing**
```svelte
<LoadingAnimation size="sm" />   <!-- 64px -->
<LoadingAnimation size="md" />   <!-- 96px -->  
<LoadingAnimation size="lg" />   <!-- 128px -->
```

#### **Customizable Message**
```svelte
<LoadingAnimation message="Loading your demo workspace..." />
<LoadingAnimation message="Loading invitation history..." />
<LoadingAnimation message="Setting up your team..." />
```

#### **Smooth Animations**
- **Staggered timing** - Each person enters at different intervals (0s, 1s, 2s)
- **Coordinated elements** - Documents, checkmarks, and sparkles sync with people movement
- **Continuous loops** - All animations repeat seamlessly
- **Floating effect** - Subtle up/down motion for the entire scene

### **🎯 Animation Timing**
```
0s  → Blue person starts walking (left → center)
1s  → Green person starts walking (right → center) 
2s  → Orange person starts walking (top → center)
1s  → First checkmark appears
2s  → Second checkmark appears  
3s  → Third checkmark appears
Continuous → Documents float, data flows, sparkles twinkle
```

### **🎨 Color Palette**
- **Building**: Neutral grays (#f3f4f6, #d1d5db)
- **People**: Brand colors (Blue #3b82f6, Green #10b981, Orange #f59e0b)
- **Checkmarks**: Success green (#10b981)
- **Data flows**: Primary blue (#3b82f6)
- **Sparkles**: Gold accent (#fbbf24)
- **Company logo**: Brand purple (#6366f1)

### **📱 Implementation**

#### **Dashboard Loading** (Full page)
```svelte

```

```

#### **Metric Card Loading** (Subtle)
```svelte
<!-- Enhanced MetricCard with skeleton loading -->
{#if loading}
  <div class="flex items-center space-x-2">
    <div class="w-4 h-4 bg-current rounded-full animate-pulse"></div>
    <div class="w-6 h-4 bg-current rounded animate-pulse"></div>
