# Runes vs Svelte Stores: Architecture Evaluation

## Executive Summary

**Verdict**: For this use case, **regular Svelte stores are superior** to runes. The runes implementation added complexity without solving the actual problem.

## Detailed Analysis

### What Runes Excel At
- **Fine-grained reactivity** in Svelte 5
- **Better performance** for frequent updates
- **More predictable** reactive behavior
- **Less boilerplate** for simple reactive state

### What Runes Don't Solve
- ❌ Async data loading timing
- ❌ Store initialization order
- ❌ Component mount lifecycle issues
- ❌ Database query sequencing
- ❌ SSR hydration timing

### Regular Svelte Stores Advantages Here
- ✅ **Mature ecosystem** with proven patterns
- ✅ **Simple mental model** - subscribe/unsubscribe
- ✅ **Works with existing code** without refactoring
- ✅ **Clear debugging** - can inspect store values directly
- ✅ **Framework agnostic** - can use in non-Svelte contexts

## Complexity Comparison

### Regular Stores (Current)
```typescript
export const applications = writable<Application[]>([]);

// Usage
$: if ($applications.length > 0) {
  // Do something
}
```

### Runes Implementation (Over-engineered)
```typescript
const applicationsStore = writable<Application[]>([]);

export const applicationsState = {
  get applications() {
    let apps: Application[] = [];
    applicationsStore.subscribe(value => apps = value)();
    return apps;
  },
  // ... more complexity
};
```

## Performance Comparison
- **Regular stores**: Minimal overhead, optimized by Svelte compiler
- **Runes**: Potential for better performance, but not relevant for this use case
- **Winner**: Regular stores (simpler = faster for this scenario)

## Maintenance Comparison
- **Regular stores**: Standard Svelte patterns, familiar to all developers
- **Runes**: Custom abstractions, requires documentation and explanation
- **Winner**: Regular stores

## When to Use Runes
1. **Heavy computation** with frequent reactive updates
2. **Svelte 5 greenfield projects** with performance requirements
3. **Complex state derivations** that benefit from fine-grained reactivity
4. **When you need** the latest Svelte 5 features

## When to Use Regular Stores
1. **Async data loading** (like this project)
2. **Cross-component state** sharing
3. **Svelte 4 compatibility** needed
4. **Team familiarity** with existing patterns
5. **Stable, proven patterns** preferred

## Recommendation

**For this project**: Remove the runes implementation entirely. The problem is a simple timing issue that should be solved with:

1. Proper reactive statement guards
2. Loading state management
3. Cleaner component lifecycle handling

**For future projects**: Consider runes for Svelte 5 when you have genuine performance requirements or complex reactive computations.
