# Root Cause Analysis: Applications Tabs Not Showing

## The Real Problem

After thorough investigation, the issue is **NOT** with stores or runes. It's a classic **initialization timing issue**:

### Evidence Analysis

1. **Store Works Correctly**: Tests prove the applications store functions properly
2. **Data Loads Successfully**: Logs show "ðŸ“± Applications loaded from database: [Object, Object] (2)"
3. **Reactive Statement Timing**: The reactive statement runs before data is loaded, showing `undefined`
4. **No Compilation Errors**: Build succeeds without issues

### The Actual Timeline

```
1. Component mounts
2. Reactive statements execute immediately with empty store
3. onMount() triggers
4. loadDemoData() executes (async)
5. Applications data loads from database
6. Store is updated
7. Reactive statements should re-run... but something prevents this
```

### True Root Cause

The issue is in the **reactive statement execution order** and **store subscription timing**. The problem is likely that:

1. The reactive statement has a dependency issue
2. The store update isn't triggering re-renders correctly
3. There's interference from other reactive statements

## Solutions (in order of preference)

### Solution 1: Proper Reactive Dependencies
```typescript
$: {
  if ($applications && Array.isArray($applications) && $applications.length > 0) {
    console.log('Applications loaded:', $applications.length);
  }
}
```

### Solution 2: Derived Store for Applications State
```typescript
export const applicationsReady = derived(applications, ($apps) => 
  $apps && Array.isArray($apps) && $apps.length > 0
);
```

### Solution 3: Explicit Loading State Management
```typescript
export const applicationsLoaded = writable(false);

// In loadDemoData function:
applications.set(transformedApps);
applicationsLoaded.set(true);
```

### What Runes Won't Fix

- Timing issues
- Data loading order
- Async operation sequencing
- Store subscription timing

The runes implementation was **over-engineering** for a timing problem.
